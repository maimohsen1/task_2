# LSTM Numerical Example Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a numerical example of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network from scratch using Python. It follows the step-by-step calculations of an LSTM cell, including forget gate, input gate, candidate cell state, cell state update, output gate, hidden state update, and final prediction.

## Files
- `lstm_numerical_example.py`: Python script implementing the LSTM forward pass and prediction.
- `README.md`: This documentation file explaining the implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install NumPy if not already installed:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python lstm_numerical_example.py
   ```

## Output
The script prints the hidden state and cell state for each time step and provides the final numerical prediction.
